This entry describe how to root Nexus One with Android build number ERD79.

== Introduction ==

In order for us to implement our application, we had to root the nexus one to read and write device input files.


== Step 1: Unlocking bootloader==
  * Connect the Nexus One to your computer which has Android SDK tool downloaded.
  * Reboot the Nexus One into fastboot (Power off and then hold down trackball while booting).
  * Type *fastboot devices* in command line to check device is recognized.
  * Type *fastboot oem unlock* to unlock the bootloader.

== Step 2: Rooting ==
  * Download and extract superboot for ERD79 at http://coblitz.codeen.org/www.romraid.com/paul/nexusone/1.1-ERD79-nexusone-superboot.zip.  If you have different build version, then check Paul's superboot forum for other versions.
  * Go to superboot extracted location using your command prompt (i.e c:\tmp\1.1-nexusone-superboot)
  * connect the phone to your computer and boot the phone into bootloader by holding down trackball while booting.
  * On windows, load the superboot by *install-superboot-windows.bat*.
  * For linux --> install-superboot-linux.sh & for Mac -->install-superboot-mac.sh
